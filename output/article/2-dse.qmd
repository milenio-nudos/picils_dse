# Self-efficacy and Digital Technologies

Self-efficacy is an orchestration or continued improvisation of multiple skills to manage the ever-changing situation around mastering an activity. As part of the forethought element of human agency, Self-efficacy is not the simple self-perception about the ability to execute an action, is concerned by judgments of how well one can execute courses of action required to deal with prospective situations. Self-efficacy is a type of self-assessment or expectatives to produce particular outcomes, crucial for reinforcing the mastery of the activity to which one is dedicated [@banduraSelfefficacyMechanismHuman1982; @banduraSelfefficacyUnifyingTheory1977].

This concept occupies a pivotal role in the causal structure of adaptation and change in learning contexts through its effect on other cognitive determinants. i) Efficacy plays a central role in the self-regulation of motivation through goal challenges and outcome expectations. ii) Efficacy determines the challenge to undertake, how much effort to expend in the endeavor, how long to persevere in the face of obstacles and failure, and whether failures are motivating or demoralizing. iii) Efficacy beliefs also play a key role in shaping the courses lives take by influencing the types of activities and environments people choose to get into. In synthesis, efficacy shapes the mindset, choices on path-life, and change of environments, crucial for creating fulfilling standards and obtaining performance accomplishments across learning activities [@bandura_selfefficacy_1995; @steele_stereotype_1995].

Self-efficacy has proven to be particularly relevant when it comes to digital technologies learning achievements. A whole thematic research agenda has opened up around self-efficacy role on the adoption and competences on digital technologies, although there are scattered efforts when it comes to measuring this construct.

The first antecedents of self-efficacy applied to digital issues resorted to 'Computer self-efficacy'. @compeau_computer_1995 proposed this early instrument focused on general computer domains and specific software application tasks. Defined as individual's perceptions of his or her ability to use computers in the accomplishment of a task (ie., using a software package for data analysis, writing a mailmerge letter using a word processor), rather than reflecting simple component skills (ie., formatting diskettes, booting up a computer, using a specific software feature such as "bolding text" or "changing margin"). The computer self-efficacy construct was criticized and overcome for neglecting the changing dynamics of digital systems, which extender the digital enviroment over computers. The items of these scales tend to become outdated rapidly [@durndellComputerSelfEfficacy2002; @weigel_technical_2014].

While the increasing importance of interconnection with technologies, the focus turn on Internet Self-efficacy, which was defined as the general one's judgment of confidence to accomplish different tasks related to online use of technologies. Internet Self-efficacy it does not refer to operative simple tasks, such as writing HTML, using a browser, or transferring files, for example. Instead, it assesses a person's judgment of their ability to apply Internet skills in a more encompassing mode, such as finding information, social communication, or troubleshooting search problems. Internet self-efficacy may be distinguished from computer self-efficacy as the belief that one can successfully perform a distinct set of behaviors required to establish, maintain, and utilize effectively the Internet over and above basic personal computer skills [@eastin_internet_2000a; @hsuInternetSelfefficacyElectronic2004]

Although this new construct partially addressed the obsolescence of technologies, the set of digital activities was reduced to a particular domain, as is the case with the Internet and online interactions. An ICT Self-efficacy scale was proposed to comprise Computer and internet tasks on the same construct. ICT Self-efficacy construct considers digital information processing and content creation [@aesaert_exploring_2014; @hatlevik_students_2018a]. Also, more advanced skills, such as programming or web development [@rohatgi_role_2016], started to be considered. Although to its new measures, ICT Self-efficacy usually presents unidimensional concepts or focuses on specific application domains (using ICT for work, school, or leisure) rather than competencies applicably for general life domains [@ulfert-blank_assessing_2022].

The current measures presented have common limitations in various ways. First, they often do not consider more recent frameworks of digital competences, such as the DigComp, regarding their level of generality, the competences included, and their multidimensionality. The DigComp describes digital competences in terms of general actions (i.e., tasks, functions), such as protecting devices or managing data, that can be applied to a heterogeneous group of individuals and are independent of specific digital systems. Most DSE scales are still system (e.g., specific computer software) or technology-specific (e.g., data storage such as floppy disc) and may thus become outdated. Second, critical competence areas, such as safety and problem-solving are often disregarded. Most of the scales focus on the informational, communicative, and creative aspects of the technologies without exhaustively capturing their dimensions of mastery. Third, the term DSE has been used interchangeably for measuring general competence beliefs (i.e., including items assessing self-concept, another competence belief) or actual proficiency. As a result, this has led to inconsistencies in the representation of the DSE construct in the literature. This is in spite of self-efficacy literature offering clear definitions of how measures should be constructed and its well-defined differentiation from related constructs [@ulfert-blank_assessing_2022].

@ulfert-blank_assessing_2022 suggests to work with a unified construct denominated Digital Self-efficacy (hereinafter DSE) to reach a high-level research on this issue. Considering the gaps and inconsistencies in previous measurements, @ulfert-blank_assessing_2022 points out that DSE construct have to (1) be theoretically-grounded multi-dimensional measures of DSE, encompassing diverse digital competence areas, (2) cover different functions and tasks of digital systems, (3) be independent of a specific digital system (e.g., Word), (4) be also labor or economical, not only educational-oriented.

# Measuring Digital Self-efficacy

Generally, Self-efficacy has two ways to be studied: As perceived capabilities for task achievement and as a self-regulatory attitude. Task self-efficacy involves the beliefs that one can or cannot perform a single instance of a circumscribed behavior at different levels of performance. Self-regulatory self-efficacy is the confidence in how one can (or could) achieve tasks in the context of potential barriers. Studies focusing on capabilities usually emphasize the magnitude of the task, i.e., its degree of difficulty or complexity, and the linear achievement of the masterization process. By contrast, studies focused on attitudinal aspects give greater importance to persistance or resistance in the face of adversities presented in the enviroment involved in an activity [@marlatt_selfefficacy_1995; @schwarzer_socialcognitive_2000; @williams_confounded_2016].

Digital self-efficacy measurements are generally based on the linear achievement of tasks, more than the development of a strong confident self-attitude with technologies. Although some studies define DSE as a unidimensional construct, measuring individualsâ€™ task achievement in using digital technologies without distinguishing between types of tools and/or levels of complexity [@hatlevik_digital_2015; @rohatgiRoleICTSelfefficacy2016], another range of studies adopt a bidimensional approach, which categorise as 'general or basic DSE' a first level of achievement considering widespread skills around handling information (browsing the web, evaluating the accuracy of information on the internet, installing programmes, communicating or collaborating through technologies (uploading content to social media, creating online profiles) and creating digital content (designing images, videos and text). A second level of achievement, jerarquically above the previous one, considers high technical expertise on computational tasks such as using programming languages, application development, or website management. Generally, is labelled as 'specialized or advanced DSE' [@pashaCrossNationalVariationsSelfEfficacy2024; @gebhardtGenderDifferencesComputer2019].

Both the unidimensional and the bidimensional approaches not only influence measurement instruments but also lead to different research findings: unidimensional models could underestimate the predictive power of DSE for complex digital enviroments, while bidimensional models offer greater explanatory precision but can introduce challenges such as construct overlap or reduced generalizability across contexts, limiting findings across educational systems and cultural contexts [@aesaertAccuracyBiasICT2017; @siddiqThereGenderGap2019; @scherer_gender_2023; @camposDigitalGenderGaps2024]. Thus, the choice between unidimensional and bidimensional models of DSE is not merely theoretical, as it has significant implications for the validity, reliability, and utility of research on digital competence development.

However, although evidence shows that self-efficacy in technological area improvement does not follow a positive linear direction with performance, it is noteworthy that studies in the area of DSE focus closely on task achievement rather than on developing attitudes for dealing with situated difficult situations in digital learning processes [@bandura_selfefficacy_1995; @fabia_students_2024; @mekheimer_technological_2025].
